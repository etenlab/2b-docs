# Dev Environment

## Setup files for the development environment using all the services

0. Put env vars to `.env` (see `.env.example`)

1. Go to the `/local` folder

2. Run following command to start all services

```sh
docker-compose --env-file ../.env up
```

If you want to run only specific services, specify them:

```sh
docker-compose --env-file ../.env up postgres keycloak graph-engine
```
Note: From the end of June 2023 Compose V1 wonâ€™t be supported anymore and will be removed from all Docker Desktop versions. `docker-compose` command will be substituted with `docker compose`.
For more information, see https://docs.docker.com/compose/.
